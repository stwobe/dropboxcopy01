#this code is taken from looking at doing cd /usr/lib64/python2.7/
#then ls
#You will see many .py and .pyc files
#this actual code is the file antigravity.py
#It looks like it will open a web-comic in your browser. Cool.
#There are Python2.7 and Python3.3 folders in /usr/lib/ and /usr/lib64
#N.B. There are tons of files in lib64 but much less, and different ..
#..ones in just lib.
#I am writing this on OpenSUSE 13.1 KDE
#It is launching Firefox! And a funny cartoon about Python and ..  
#..antigravity...
#In Interactive style, you can just type   import antigravity  and you..
#.. get Firefox launched with the comic.
#Awesome. :D
